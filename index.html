            <p>Hi, my name is Luis Alejandro Saenz. I graduated in Electronic Engineering 
                from Universidad Tecnológica Boliviana, and I'm currently studying 
                Software Development at BYU-Idaho Online. 
                I’m passionate about technology, focusing on Circuit Design, 
                Embedded Systems, and Telecommunications. I enjoy learning, working in teams, 
                and exploring topics like space, music, and travel. 
                My volunteer experiences have helped me grow in leadership and empathy, 
                and my goal is to improve people’s lives and contribute to science 
                through innovative projects.</p>
